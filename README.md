A Note From The Author:

Louis Carter is a man of mystery. A coder so proficient, he once wrote a recursive function that ended up rewriting itself in a better version. He doesn’t need debugging because bugs ask him for help.

Rumor has it that when Louis Carter encountered a 404 error, the internet apologized to him. And when he compiles code, even the compiler says, “I can’t wait to see what he does next.”

He doesn’t use Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow uses him.

Louis Carter once wrote an entire algorithm on a napkin, and the napkin now holds a PhD in computer science. His code doesn’t need comments – it just understands itself.

If you encounter an infinite loop in his code, don’t panic. It’s probably just a wormhole to another dimension, where his code is writing itself into the future.

Remember, when you’re stuck, just ask yourself: “What would Louis Carter do?” And then prepare to be amazed by the answer, which may involve lasers, quantum computing, and a large coffee.
